### Welcome to my GitHub, I'm Denis Di Marco a Back-End Java Spring Developer.


I love to work with Java and Spring Framework on the backend side.

Currently I'm learning a bit of Angular and React to go to a more FullStack profile. 

My favorites development tools are: 
  - IntelliJ Idea, WebStorm, DataGrip.
  - GitKraken
